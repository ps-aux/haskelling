# haskelling

Basic fun with Haskell which goes well with a glass of red wine :)

1. Install [`stack`](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/)

2. Setup build, exec, watch loop

    `stack build --file-watch --fast --pedantic --exec "stack exec haskelling"`

3. Get a glass of wine and start hacking
